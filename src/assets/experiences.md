## High Performance Architecture Lab
*<span class="text-lg text-gray-10">Undergraduate Research Assistant (Jan 2023 - Present)</span>*

I am working at the <span class="highlight">High Performance Architechture
Lab</span> at Georgia Tech on <span class="highlight">In-Storage GPU scheduling
strategies</span> to maximize memory capacity and performance in GPUs inflicted
by memory latency in SSD access.access. I have read papers proposing novel
approaches to SSD scheduling, including <span class="highlight"> ZnG, SBIOS,
and PGIS </span>. Additionally, I have explored the internal workings of <span
class="highlight"> MacSim </span> and explored DRAM Simulator Code. With the
knowledge gained from these papers and programs, I am now utilizing strategies
proposed in the papers to develop an outline of a <span class="highlight">
warp-based SSD scheduling algorithm </span>.

## NCR Corporation
*<span class="text-lg text-gray-10">Software Developer (May 2022 - August 2022)</span>*

For 12 weeks, I worked at the NCR Corporation
Headquarters in Altanta, GA. I worked on the <span class="highlight">Retail
Innovation - Edge Team</span>.

With a team of 5 other interns, I worked on the <span class="highlight"> GoKart
Selling Service</span>, which is a API written in the <span
class="highlight">Fiber Web Server</span> in Golang. This service allows for
the support of <span class="highlight">creation, storage, and management of a
cart object </span> achieved with a unique cart identifier. The cart supports
the inclusion of items retrieved through requests to the <span
class="highlight"> NCR BSP Catalog API</span>, and store locations through to
the <span class="highlight">BSP Site API</span>. The cart also supports a
selling engine and its pertinent calculations like calculating gross-totals,
totals with promotions applied, exemptions applied, and taxes applied, as well
as the calculation and handling of returns. The app is meant to work with
exsisting <span class="highlight"> retail e-commerce apps </span> and <span
class="highlight">Point of Sale systems</span>. This was made to the replace
the existing .NET API as this was rather bulky and slow, we managed to cut down
the size of the binary from 100MB to just <span class="highlight"> 5MB </span>
at comparable performance. 

Along with the api, we worked on a sample e-commerce website written in <span
class="highlight">Next.js </span>on incorporating API into the frontend. To
help with development, I also made a <span class="highlight">bash script
</span> with 12 different presets to help in development, building, running and
deployment to Google Cloud Platform.

*<span class="text-lg text-gray-10">Software Developer (November 2021 - Present)</span>*

I am working in a start up at Georgia Tech in building a MVP. I worked on
developing a <span class="highlight">Full-Stack Website</span> and working on
fine tuning an NLP model for more accurate results. I worked on a machine
learning pipeline that uses <span class="highlight">UMAP</span> to map the
relevant word embeddings of pieces of text onto a 2D graph, <span
class="highlight">FAISS</span> to effieciently cluster these texts and an <span
class="highlight">LDA model</span> on these clusters to find accurate topics
for these. In the frontend, I worked on optimizing WordCloud of test using
    <span class="highlight">ReactFlow</span>.
