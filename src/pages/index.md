# Hi, I am Kinshuk Phalke

I am sophomore at the Georgia Institute of technology, Atlanta where I major in
Computer Science. I specialize in Systems and Architecture and Artificial
Intelligence. I am interested in Financial Technologies, Machine Learning
Research, Programming Languages, Operating Systems and Processor Architecture.


Currently, I am researching at the High Performance Architecture Labs at
Georgia Tech with Xueyang Yang about In-Storage GPU Scheduling. I'm also
working on personal projects related to making my own DIY [**shell**]("https://github.com/xinslu/brush") in C using system calls and
writing a fractal based 3-D platformer using SFML in C++.


I love watching thriller and/or mystery mvies/TV shows, currently my favourites
stand at [**Dark**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series)) and
[**Better Call Saul**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul).
I also love listening to Avicii, Mac Miller and The Weekend.

Feel free to reach out to me via my
[**mail**](mailto:phalkekinshuk@gmail.com) to talk about anything.
