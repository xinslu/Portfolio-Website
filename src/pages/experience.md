# Experience

## Meta
*Software Engineering Intern (May 2025 - August 2025)*

I worked as a **Software Engineering Intern** on the **Click to Message Adoption Team**, creating an experience that allows users to replace copyrighted audio on reels with royalty-free music.

Key achievements include:
- Designed and launched a new feature enabling users to replace reel audio with **copyright-free tracks**, driving ad creation.
- Built a video and audio editor with **real-time preview** and audio track selection streamlining content editing.
- Developed **end-to-end test suites** and led **engagement experiments** to assess interactions on new experience.

## NCR Voyix
*Software Engineering Intern (May 2024 - August 2024)*

I worked as a **Software Engineering Intern** on the **Retail Innovation Team**, creating a deployable **testing bench** using **Electron.js**. 

Key achievements include:
- Deploying the test bench on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to run end-to-end tests written by the team. 
- Enabling the running of the test bench in a headed mode by integrating **noVNC** and **XServer** services on the cloud. 
- Implementing automatic deployment using a **Feature Flag** on **LaunchDarkly**.
- Reducing testing setup time by **10x** (from 10 minutes to 1 minute).

This enhanced the team's productivity and streamlined the testing workflow.

## NCR Corporation
*Software Engineering Intern Team Lead (May 2023 - August 2023)*

As a Team Lead, I guided a team of five interns on the Retail Innovation - Edge Team. My primary contribution was developing a **Mock Organization Microservice** using **Flask** in Python. This API generated sample retail organizations populated with categorized catalogs and geographic locations across the country.

Key achievements include:
- Processing a product catalog database derived from open-source data.
- Training and deploying **Brand Recognition NER Models** to accurately predict and anonymize brand names in product titles.
- Randomizing product catalog generation using open location datasets.
- Designing a robust **CI/CD pipeline** for testing and seamless microservice deployment.

My leadership and technical contributions earned me the **GT Intern of the Year** award.

## High Performance Architecture Lab
*Undergraduate Research Assistant (Jan 2023 - May 2024)*

At the High-Performance Architecture Lab at Georgia Tech, I researched **In-Storage GPU Scheduling Strategies** to optimize memory capacity and performance, particularly addressing memory latency in SSD access.

Key achievements include:
- Studying cutting-edge scheduling approaches like **ZnG**, **SBIOS**, **Amphibian** and **PGIS**.
- Gaining hands-on experience with **MacSim** and **MQSim**.
- Developing a SSD Scheduling algorithm based on **Red-Black Trees** to account for **Garbage Collection** and **Channel-Level Parallelism**.
- Publishing my undergraduate thesis: **Maximizing SSD Bandwidth Efficiency Through In-Storage GPU Integration**

## NCR Corporation
*Software Engineering Intern (May 2022 - August 2022)*

During this internship with the Retail Innovation - Edge Team, I contributed to the **GoKart Selling Service**, a lightweight **Fiber Web Server** API in Golang. This service supported cart creation, management, and selling functionalities.

Key achievements include:
- Integrating the API with **NCR BSP Catalog API** and **BSP Site API** for item and location retrieval.
- Enhancing the cart system to handle calculations for taxes, promotions, and returns, enabling seamless integration with **e-commerce apps** and **Point-of-Sale systems**.
- Reducing binary size from 100MB to **5MB** without compromising performance.
- Designing a **CI/CD pipeline** for testing and GCP deployment.
- Building a sample **Next.js e-commerce website** to demonstrate API integration, supported by a custom **bash script** to automate development and deployment tasks.

## Notitia
*Software Developer (November 2021 - December 2022)*

At Notitia, a Georgia Tech startup, I contributed to building an MVP that combined full-stack web development with machine learning.

Key achievements include:
- Developing a **machine learning pipeline** using **UMAP** for embedding visualization, **FAISS** for efficient text clustering, and an **LDA model** for topic extraction.
- Optimizing front-end **WordCloud** visualizations using **ReactFlow**.
- Delivering a polished product that integrated complex NLP workflows into a user-friendly interface.
