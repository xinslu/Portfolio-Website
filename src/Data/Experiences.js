This service allows for the support of <span class="highlight">creation, storage, and management of a cart object </span> achieved with a unique cart identifier. The cart supports the inclusion of items retrieved through requests to the <span class="highlight"> NCR BSP Catalog API</span>, and store locations through to the <span class="highlight">BSP Site API</span>. The cart also supports a selling engine and its pertinent calculations like calculating gross-totals, totals with promotions applied, totals with exemptions applied, and totals with taxes applied, as well as the calculation and handling of returns. The app is meant to work with exsisting <span class="highlight"> retail e-commerce apps </span> and <span class="highlight">Point of Sale systems</span>. Worked with Golang in creating the backend API and with <span class="highlight">Next.js </span>on incorporating API into the frontend. Built a <span class="highlight">bash script </span>with 12 different presets to help in development, building, running and deployment.`,
