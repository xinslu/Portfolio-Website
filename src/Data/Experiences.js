I worked on developing a <span class="highlight">Full-Stack Website</span> and working on fine tuning an NLP model for more accurate results. I worked on a machine learning pipeline that uses <span class="highlight">UMAP</span> to map the relevant word embeddings of pieces of text onto a 2D graph, <span class="highlight">FAISS</span> to effieciently cluster these texts and an <span class="highlight">LDA model</span> on these clusters to find accurate topics for these. In the frontend, I worked on optimizing WordCloud of test using <span class="highlight">ReactFlow</span>.`,

Researching the correlation between <span class="highlight">ghrelin</span>, the hunger hormone, and other factors like <span class="highlight">BMI, Age, Dietary Habits, Diet Regime</span>, we built a core Machine Learning model that can <span class="highlight">predict the exact amount of calories a person has to consume at any time of the day</span>. The user can input his list of favourite foods in the sign up page, keep a track of calorie consumption trends in the home page, and look at food to be consumed at the time of the day in results. I worked with <span class="highlight">Professor Lisa Winstanley</span> on User Expereince and Design and <span class="highlight">Dr. Tan Wee Kek</span> on core functionality.`,

I spent some time learning about the basics of <span class="highlight">micro-controllers, PWMs, and Oscillatory circuits</span>. I also learned and used <span class="highlight">TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib to make a basic image recognition software using a Kaggle dataset</span>. I delved deeper into understanding <span class="highlight">Convoluted Neural Networks and Deep Learning</span>. Outside of coding, I designed a Bluetooth controlled car and interfaced it with an android mobile phone to be controlled remotely.`,
